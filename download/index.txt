Latest stable release:
-----------------------

The latest stable release is Eyegrade 0.9.
The recommended way of installation,
depending on your operating system, is:

- Windows installer:
  `eyegrade-setup-0.9.exe <https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/releases/download/eyegrade-0.9/eyegrade-setup-0.9.exe>`_

- Linux portable binary files:
  `eyegrade-0.9-bin-linux.tar.gz <https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/releases/download/eyegrade-0.9/eyegrade-0.9-bin-linux.tar.gz>`_
  (these binaries should be compatible with any reasonably recent distribution,
  more or less from 2016 or more recent).

- Through `pipx <https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx>`_.
  Just run: `pipx install eyegrade`.

You'll find detailed installation instructions
in the `user guide <../doc/user-manual/#installing-eyegrade>`_.

There is no support for Mac OS/X yet.
Volunteers for finding and documenting how to install it
on that platform are welcome.

If you are trying Eyegrade for the first time,
you may want to go through the
`quick start guide <../quick-start-guide/>`_.

Checksums
............

On Windows, you can verify the checksum of the installer
from a command-line console
by entering the following command::

  certUtil -hashfile eyegrade-setup-0.9.exe SHA512

On Linux, run::

  sha512sum eyegrade-0.9-bin-linux.tar.gz

Installation through pip:
............................

If you are familiar with the Python ecosystem,
you can try to get Eyegrade from PyPI instead.
Install Python 3.6 or a later release.
Then, run::

    python3 -m pip install eyegrade

Nevertheless, I'd rather install eyegrade through `pipx`
as explained in the `user guide <../doc/user-manual/#installing-eyegrade>`_.
