Main features
--------------------------

The main features of Eyegrade are:

- **Grading the exams:**
  By using a webcam,
  the graphical user interface of Eyegrade
  allows you to grade your exams.
  Eyegrade is able to recognize not only the answers to the questions,
  but also the identity of the student
  by using its hand-written digit recognition module.
  The whole process is supervised by the user
  in order to detect and fix potential detection errors.

- **Exporting grades:**
  Grades can be exported in CSV format,
  compatible with other programs such as spreadsheets.

- **Typesetting the exams:**
  Although you can create your exams with other tools,
  Eyegrade integrates an utility to creating MCQ exams.
  It is able to create your exams in PDF format.
  Eyegrade can automatically build several versions of the exam
  by shuffling questions and the choices within the questions.

Here is a short demonstration video of an early version of Eyegrade.
Please note that the user interface has been greatly improved since then:
