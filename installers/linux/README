In order to create a single-file Linux executable file:

1.- Install pyinstaller with pip.

2.- Check that six and packaging are also installed. The should have
been installed with pyinstaller automatically, but I've seen the
problem that they dind't get installed. Install them with pip if
necessary.

3.- From the main directory of the eyegrade source distribution, run:

pyinstaller installers/pyinstaller/eyegrade.spec
pyinstaller installers/pyinstaller/eyegrade-create.spec

The executable files eyegrade and eyegrade-create will appear inside
the "dist" directory.

Note that according to:

https://pythonhosted.org/PyInstaller/usage.html#making-linux-apps-forward-compatible

your executable files won't work in environments in which the
installed version of libc is older than the version you have in the
environment in which you run pyinstaller to create the executable
file.

In addition, if you build the executable file on a 64-bit OS, it will
run only on 64-bit OSs. If you build it on a 32-bin OS, it will run
only on 32-bit OSs.
