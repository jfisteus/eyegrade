Eyegrade uses a webcam to grade MCQ (multiple choice question)
exams. Needing just a cheap low-end webcam, it aims to be a low-cost
and portable solution available to everyone, on the contrary to other
solutions based on scanners.

Eyegrade is still alpha. It is fully functional and has been used in
several courses at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid since 2010.
Its use is encouraged for tech-savvy people. However, it still
needs great improvements in its user-friendliness in order to be
usable for the general public.

The main features of Eyegrade are:

- Typesetting exams: Although you can create your exams with other tools,
Eyegrade integrates an utility to creating MCQ exams. It is able to
create your exams in PDF format.  Eyegrade can automatically build
several versions of the exam by reordering questions and choices
within questions.

- Grading exams: Using a webcam, the graphical user interface of
Eyegrade allows you to grade your exam. Eyegrade is able to recognize
not only the answers to the questions, but also the identity of the
student by using its hand-written digit cognition module. The whole
process is supervised by the user in order to detect and fix potential
errors of the system.

- Extracting statistics: you can view question-by-question statistics in
order to analyze which topics are clear to the majority of your
students, and which topics need further work.

- Exporting grades: grades can be exported in CSV format, compatible
with other programs such as spreadsheets.
